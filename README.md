## DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
- users will mint an nft
- nft will be made by me w default metadata
- user challenges another nft user
- user with higher strength has a higher chance of winning logic(random)
- user who wins gets strength upgraded by a certain number 
- image of nft is upgraded and can be viewed through opensea...

## FURTHER ADVANCEMENTS
- better svgs, if strength of a user is above a certain level let svg be animated..svg will also be as random as possible
- The game will be a very cool game
- We will have our very own marketplace(makes it easier for users to sell their nfts immediately)
- monetize the application(some certain nft will be put in contract)
